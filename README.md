# Domestication syndrome in the microbiome analyses

This repository can be used to replicate analyses done to identify if there is a "universal" signal of domestication in the gut microbiomes of animals. For each set of analyses, I compared wild vs. domestic as well as within wild and within domestic to understand if particular host species were driving the difference.

The folders are organized as such:
1. Preprocessing and assembly
3. Taxonomic annotation using Kraken2
4. Functional annotation for CAZymes, KEGG orthologs, AMR genes
5. Metagenomic-assembled genomes assembly, taxonomic annotation, and functional annotation
6. Statistical analyses
